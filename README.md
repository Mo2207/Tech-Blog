# Tech Blog

## Description:
  
This application is a mock blog page for tech. It uses handlebars.js as the templating engine and Sequelize as the ORM.
  - My motivation for this project was to learn how to use authentication middleware when creating a login/signup for an application.
  - I built this application to get better at using the MVC folder structure.
  - Building this project I learned how handlebars can be rendered as a response to get requests, instead of just html pages or json like I've done in the past.
